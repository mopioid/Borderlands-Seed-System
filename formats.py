class SeedFormat:
    """
    Seed format objects define the appearance and functionality of seeds. They
    dictate what seeds will look like when users create, manage, and share
    them, as well as what information is encoded into and decoded from seeds
    during generation and loading.

    Args:
        version:
            The version number this seed format represents. This is encoded
            into seed strings, and is ultimately used to match users' seed
            strings back to this this seed format.

        format_string:
            The final appearance of seeds of this format, as the user will see
            them.

            When specifying the format string, instances of the character 'X'
            are used to designate where the actual data representing each seed
            should be inserted. Any non-alphanumeric character can be used for
            decoration.

            For example, the format string 'XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX` will result in
            seeds with the appearance 'qadle-ta377-777ry'.

            The number of 'X' characters in the format string determines how
            many bits of data it can represent. Available bits are consumed by
            the 5 bit version number, followed by the seed format's options,
            and then any remaining are dedicated to randomness.

            Thus, when designing a format string, a sufficent quantity of X's
            are required to reach your desired level of randomess. To assist in
            this while designing a format, you may check the SeedFormat's
            `variant_count`.

            Finally, as per the base32 specification, 'X' quantities whose
            modulos of 8 equal 1, 3, or 6 cannot be used. for these,
            SeedFormatError is raised, containing a suggestion of an alternate
            quantity.

        seed_options:
            The options that can be represented by the seed format.

            These options will also determine how the options are presented to
            the user in the seed generation menu. You may include any
            `BaseSeedOption` in this sequence, including `GroupedSeedOption`
            and `NestedSeedOption`, however these will only appear in the
            seed generation menu.
